Hey, I am Simon He, a fanatical programmers.

This page is meant to share some of the projects I've done and some of the things I've been doing lately.

Recently，i always follow [antfu](https://github.com/antfu), he makes me gain a lot, and I even post some new news on Twitter every day and follow the latest github technical information

I'm not typing code for work, but because I love it, I'll be happy to pull requests for some open source projects in GitHubs.

Hopefully more people can join me and love the code I write as much as I do.
