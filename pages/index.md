<vivid-typing   spilt-tag="span" content="Hey, I am Simon He, a fanatical programmers located in Shanghai, China." />

Through this page, I would like to share with you some projects I’ve done and what I’ve been through. 

Recently, I have been following [<span i-mdi:face-man-outline/>Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu) for a couple months, his enthusiasm to coding and dedication really inspired me a lot. Now, I’m used to learning industry news from Twitter and digging myself in those forward-looking feature and innovative ecological technology. 

I’m also an active user on GitHub to communicate with people have same ambition and interests on the latest technical information and ideas. Happy to be one of the contributors for some open-source projects. 

Moreover, highly recommend my terminal configuration through the link [here](/posts/ohMyZsh-alias) and hope this could bring you some convenience during your encoding process.  

I wanna say - I don’t regard it as my work, it’s an indispensable part of my life. How about you? Join me to fall in love with coding along this journey. 

I’m eagerly to have in-depth communication with you and looking forward to hearing your voice via below listed channels.
