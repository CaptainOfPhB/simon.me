  Hey, I am Simon He, a fanatical programmers.
</Typing>

This page is meant to share some of the projects I've done and some of the things I've been doing lately.

Recently，i always follow [antfu](https://github.com/antfu), he makes me gain a lot, and I even learn fresh news on Twitter every day and follow the latest github technical information.

I'm not typing code for work, just because I love it, I'll be happy to be  a Contributor for some open source projects on GitHubs.

Hopefully more people can join me and love the code they write as much as I do.

If you have any technical questions, you are welcome to come and talk to me.

By the way, I would like to share my [zshrc configuration](https://github.com/Simon-He95/directory-configuration) with you, hoping to bring you the convenience of encoding.
